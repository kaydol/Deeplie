A tool for searching mistakes in .pscript files and visualisation of dialogue trees.

Writing quests for Legends of Equestria is not an easy process. Before I joined the team the typical approach was to throw in a script, then live-test on the server to see if it throws any errors. The file (or multiple files) with the quest was uploaded to the live server, then via a special command in the text chat the quest that was ran on the server was updated with the new version.

After that, a different person was assigned to test if the quest works and to find out possible bugs. There was no way to see if the quest contained any typos or script errors until anybody has ran into it. Although I was implementing my quests in the most diligent way, I was making typos and mistakes. Some of the quests had such a huge dialogue tree that it was virtually impossible to keep the whole tree in one's head. 

I wasn't satisfied with how difficult and slow the process of adding a new quest was. So I decided to create a text editor that would perform a syntax analysis and report any syntax mistakes on the fly, saving lots and lots of time to the script implementation employees. 

The program had to be intuitive and simple and designed to be used by people who had no previous knowledge or experience with script implementation or programming.
